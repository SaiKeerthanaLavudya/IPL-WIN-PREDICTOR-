# 🏏 IPL Win Predictor

**A machine learning-based application that predicts IPL match winners using historical data from 2008 to 2024.**

## 📌 Introduction
Cricket is unpredictable, but with the right data and machine learning models, we can estimate match outcomes! The **IPL Win Predictor** leverages historical IPL data to predict match winners based on various factors like team performance, toss, venue, and past records.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Predict match winners based on team selection and match conditions  
✅ Uses IPL data from 2008-2024 for accurate predictions  
✅ User-friendly web interface for seamless interactions  
✅ Powered by machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
✅ Deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions  

## 📂 Dataset
The predictor is trained using the following datasets:
- **`matches.csv`** – Contains match details, including teams, venue, toss, and outcomes.
- **`deliveries.csv`** – Provides ball-by-ball data of IPL matches, including batting and bowling stats.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Supervised Learning Algorithms)
- **Streamlit** (For front-end UI)
- **Flask** (Optional for backend API integration)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For data preprocessing and model training)

## 🔧 Setup & Usage
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaiKeerthanaLavudya/IPL-WIN-PREDICTOR-
cd IPL-WIN-PREDICTOR-
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Train the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook code.ipynb
```

### 4️⃣ Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Model Performance
The model is trained using multiple algorithms, and accuracy is evaluated to select the best-performing model. The chosen model (`ipl_win_predictor.pkl`) predicts IPL match outcomes with high accuracy.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
🚀 Live IPL data integration for real-time predictions  
🚀 Incorporate player form & injuries for better accuracy  
🚀 Improve UI with more interactive visualizations  
🚀 Deploy on cloud for global access
